Have you ever wondered how social networks, such as Facebook, recommend friends to you? Most of the social networks use highly sophisticated algorithms for this, but for this assignment you will implement a fairly naive algorithm to recommend the most likely new friend to users of a social network. In particular, you will recommend the most probable user to befriend based upon the intersection of your common friends. In other words, the user that you will suggest to Person A is the person who has the most friends in common with Person A, but who currently is not friends with Person A. Five text files have been provided for you to run your program with. Each represents a social network. Three are small test files containing a made-up set of users and their friendships (these files are net1.txt, net2.txt and net3.txt). The two are a subset of a real Facebook dataset, which was obtained from: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/egonets-Facebook.htmlThe format of all five files is the same:The first line of the file is an integer representing the number of users in the given network. The following lines are of the form: user_u user_v where user_u and user_v are the (non-negative integer) IDs of two users who are friends. In addition user_u is always less than user_v
